# MCP Enterprise PR Reviewer - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Building a production-ready AI PR Reviewer system using Model Context Protocol (MCP) that integrates GitHub, Slack, and Asana for enterprise developer workflows.

## Architecture Philosophy
This roadmap follows enterprise software engineering principles:
- **Modular Design**: Each MCP server is a standalone, testable component
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication incrementally
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Design decisions consider scalability and extensibility
- **Production Readiness**: Security, observability, and reliability built-in from day one

## Phase 1: Foundation - Individual MCP Servers
*Goal: Build standalone, testable MCP servers using FastMCP*

### PR-1: Asana MCP Server ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Environment configuration for tokens and workspace IDs
- ✅ Basic logging and validation
- ✅ Tool tagging for future registry integration

**Future Considerations**:
- Design API client interface that can be extended for batch operations
- Structure tool responses for consistent error handling across all servers
- Implement rate limiting patterns that will scale to other API integrations

**Deliverables**:
